      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a student at the University of Sydney's web development bootcamp. My full time job is as a Product Specialist for an electronic health record company.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from the United States. Specifically, I'm from the town of Gorham in the state of New Hampshire.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hiking, history, comedy performances, and, or course, coding.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be working as a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Sydney, Australia.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've worked in technology for years but mostly in implementation, business analysis, product, and data analysis roles. Over the years, I've realised that what I enjoy most about working in technology is building things. Learning the coding skills necessary to be a web developer will give me the skills necessary to transition from a role where I design and document solutions to a role where I can do what I truly enjoy, building the solutions.</p>
